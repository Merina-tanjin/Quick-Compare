<p><h6>The quick compare app compares privacy and security between a few least developed countries and a few developed countries. In this application, we may select two countries and up to five websites from each to evaluate privacy and security factors. Here, government and private websites can be compared separately to see one is more secure than the others. The main goal of this application was to demonstrate that the websites of a few nations, particularly Bangladesh, are extremely vulnerable and pose significant security threats, as well as a lack of user privacy. To determine the outcome, we used several privacy and security parameters. We employed Password authentication standards, Password recovery, Captcha Security question, HTTPS channels, and a password strength meter for the privacy factor. We chose SSL certificate, cookies, HTTPS protocol status, XSS attack, and SQL injection as security factors. We assigned 1 point to each website that is secure from these assaults or maintains all privacy and security elements, and 0 points to any website that does not. As a consequence, we were able to generate a final outcome for each website. We also graphically represent the whole result so that it is easier to comprehend.
We also have a paper in this topic where we examine Privacy and Security Factors of Government Websites and Private Websites in Bangladesh and USA.</h6></p>
